## Open sourcing creatorstory

creatorstory has been sunset for some time now. 

<p><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/post_images/creatorstory.png" alt="" class="align-center" /></p>
<figcaption>how creatorstory looked like</figcaption>

I've obvioulsy learned immensely from the wonderful journey that happens in the creation and ending of a new product (wrote a few words about it on [This is NOT a startup post-mortem](https://www.eskinasy.com/hen/not-startup-post-mortem/ "NOT a startup post-mortem")). The biggest learning, however, was more personal: I've learned that I could be resourceful beyond what my skills limit me.

So, in the hope that the code might come useful to a resourceful one out there, growing a community and on the lookout for a product that helps them curate crowdsourced member-contributions, I'm open-sourcing the product. 

You can find it on github: [creatorstory on GitHub](https://github.com/creatorstory/creatorstory-app "creatorstory open source")

The product can be specially interesting if videos are important for the interest-group. There is also a forum in the product, so topical discussions can be facilitated. Browser-notifications, transactional-email-notifications & integration with Mailchimp for Campaigns and Newsletters also implemented.

creatorstory was a heavily customized Telescope (Meteor.Js) app that was used by members of the creatorstory community to curate videos posted by other members of the community and to discuss in a forum-like space.

The tech-stack is:

* Telescope
* Meteor.js
* MongoDB
* Azure
* Mailchimp

<p class="notice">
  _This comes with a disclaimer, though: the project is unmaintained and Meteor.js has moved on substantially since I've had the creatorstory in production.
