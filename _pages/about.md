Hi, I'm Pat.

On this site, youâ€™ll find my writings on some of my favourite things:

<p class="notice">
  <strong>Decentralized, Distributed and Federated systems | Open Source Software | Digital Privacy | Artificial Intelligence | Cryptocurrency | Data Science | Product Management | InfoSec | Leadership | Decentralized Governance | Supply Chains | Ethical Design | Economics | Economic Empowerment | Plant-Based Lifestyle | Yoga | Jogging | Venture Capital | Capital Markets | Startups | Mandarin</strong>
</p>

You can also find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/celue), [Medium](https://medium.com/@celue), [Linkedin](https://linkedin.com/in/pateskinasy) and [Github](https://github.com/pateskinasy). You should join my (infrequent) email [Newsletter](https://upscri.be/611534) for more content not published here.

The best way to contact me is [via Twitter](https://twitter.com/celue). Otherwise, drop a note [here](/contact).

I'm now busy with own project (in stealth). Most recently [hen.ai](https://www.hen.ai) and [creatorstory](https://www.creatorstory.com).

Then: A fifteen years' career in B2B deep tech across 4 continents.

I am curious about everything, dig making really complex stuff simple and am a massive product geek. Being an Engineer and Economist, I became fascinated by decentralization and federation (I know...soo predictable. And yes, I'll probably read - or skim - your white paper if I come across it). I'm specially interested in initiatives that help boost economic empowerment.

Otherwise, you'll find me with âˆž tabs open in my browser, eating ðŸŒ± food, doing yoga, jogging or enjoying the outdoors.
